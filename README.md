## Description
This project is the back-end logic of an E-Commerce application. It helps the user define the data needed to represent Products, Categories, and Tags as well as the relationships between them. Using the application Insomnia a user can exercise the routes of the express server to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete operations on all the major models represented in the application.
## Installation 
install node and all relevent dependencies, set up the .env file with your MySQL username and password, use the db/schema.sql file to create the database locally, then run node seeds/index.js to seed the initial data.
## Usage 
In the project directory run node server.js to start the server. Using Insomnia set up the get, post, put and delete routes for products, categories and tags to manipulate the data.
